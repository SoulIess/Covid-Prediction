# Problem Statement
In December 2019, the first cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) were reported in
Wuhan, China. The high prevalence of Covid-19 has made it a new pandemic in most
countries. Hence for the longevity of the world, it is imperative for researchers to understand
and predict the transmission of the virus.
Operating upon two provided COVID-19 case data sets, the goal of this project is to evaluate
various models on their performance in predicting Covid-19 outcome cases. Through tuning
hyperparameters, cross-validations, and comparing various model predictions against each
other, the aim is to find the best-performing model based on macro-F1 values for Covid-19
